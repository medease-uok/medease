# Contributing to MedEase

Thank you for contributing to the MedEase Hospital Management System! This guide will help you understand our development workflow and best practices.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1. Pick a Task from Jira
- Visit: https://medease-uok.atlassian.net
- Find your assigned task (e.g., MEDEASE-252)
- Move it to "In Progress"

### 2. Create a Branch
Follow the naming convention: `<your-name>/<description>`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b yourname/feature-description
```

**Examples:**
- `dhanika/user-authentication`
- `dhanika/fix-login-bug`
- `dhanika/update-readme`

### 3. Write Code
Make your changes following our coding standards.

### 4. Commit with Jira Reference
**IMPORTANT:** Always include the Jira issue key in your commit message.

```bash
git commit -m "MEDEASE-252: Add user authentication feature"
```

**Format:**
- `MEDEASE-XXX: <description>` - Standard format
- `MEDEASE-XXX: <type>: <description>` - With type prefix

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "MEDEASE-123: Implement login API endpoint"
git commit -m "MEDEASE-456: Fix authentication bug"
git commit -m "MEDEASE-789: Update README documentation"
```

### 5. Push Your Branch
```bash
git push -u origin yourname/feature-description
```

### 6. Create Pull Request
**PR Title Format (choose one):**
- `MEDEASE-XXX: Description` (Recommended)
- `feat(scope): description` (Conventional commits)
- `fix: description`

**Examples:**
- ✅ `MEDEASE-252: Add user authentication`
- ✅ `feat(auth): implement JWT authentication`
- ✅ `fix(login): resolve session timeout issue`
- ❌ `Added new feature` (Missing Jira reference)

**PR Description:**
Fill out the template, including:
- Description of changes
- Type of change
- **Jira Reference** (MEDEASE-XXX)
- Related GitHub issue (if applicable)

```markdown
## Jira Reference
**Jira Issue:** MEDEASE-252
**Link:** https://medease-uok.atlassian.net/browse/MEDEASE-252

## Related Issues
Fixes #252
```

## 🔄 Jira-GitHub Integration

Our repository is integrated with Jira to provide automatic tracking and visibility.

### What Happens Automatically:

1. **Commits with Jira Keys:**
   - Show up in Jira Development panel
   - Link to the Jira issue automatically
   - Provide full traceability

2. **Pull Requests:**
   - Automatically linked to Jira issues
   - Bot adds Jira links to PR
   - Status updates reflect in Jira

3. **PR Labels:**
   - `jira-linked` label added automatically
   - Helps filter PRs by Jira status

### Validation Checks:

Our CI/CD pipeline validates:
- ✅ PR title format (Jira key or conventional commits)
- ✅ Jira reference in title or description
- ✅ Issue linkage (Fixes #123)
- ✅ Commit messages (warns if no Jira reference)

## 📝 Best Practices

### Commit Messages

**Good:**
```bash
MEDEASE-123: Add user registration endpoint
MEDEASE-456: Fix bug in login validation
MEDEASE-789: Update API documentation
```

**Bad:**
```bash
Fixed bug                    # No Jira reference
WIP                          # Not descriptive
Update code                  # Too vague
asdfasdf                     # Unprofessional
```

### Branch Names

**Good:**
```
dhanika/user-authentication
dhanika/fix-payment-bug
dhanika/update-readme
```

**Bad:**
```
feature                      # Too vague
my-branch                    # Not descriptive
temp                         # Unclear purpose
```

## 🚀 Smart Commits (Advanced)

Use Jira smart commits to take actions directly from GitHub:

```

### Log Work Time:
```bash
git commit -m "MEDEASE-123 #time 2h 30m Implementing auth logic"
```

### Close Jira Issue:
```bash
git commit -m "MEDEASE-123 #close Completed user authentication"
```

### Combine Multiple Actions:
```bash
git commit -m "MEDEASE-123 #comment Finished testing #time 1h #close"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### PR Validation Failed?

**Issue:** "PR title must follow conventional commit format"
- **Fix:** Add Jira key: `MEDEASE-123: Your description`

**Issue:** "PR must reference a Jira issue"
- **Fix:** Add Jira reference in PR description:
  ```markdown
  **Jira Issue:** MEDEASE-123
  ```

**Issue:** "PR description must link to an issue"
- **Fix:** Add `Fixes #123` in description

### Commits Missing Jira Reference?

You'll get a warning comment. While not blocking, it's best practice to include Jira keys.
